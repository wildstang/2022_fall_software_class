// We're going to pseudo-code a subsystem. This means, write down in english what each line of code does instead of actually programming it
// i.e. to create an array, just write "create array myArray" and describe what's in it

// The subsystem you will pseudo-code has the following controls and motors
// a motor runs intake wheels
// a motor runs some feed wheels
// a motor runs some launcher wheels
// a pneumatic deploys/retracts the intake
// holding the a button deploys the intake and runs the intake wheels at 100%
// holding the right trigger runs the feed wheels at 100%
// holding the left trigger runs the launcher wheels at the launcher speed
// left bumper sets the launcher speed to 50%
// right bumper sets the launcher speed to 100%
// left and right bumper at the same time sets the launcher speed to 75%

// Write the pseudo-code for init(), update(), and inputUpdate() to run this subsystem
