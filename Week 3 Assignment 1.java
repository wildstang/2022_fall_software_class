// We're now doing fizzbuzz extreme! Create your own object "Widget" that will handle each combination
// of phrases and numbers to be divisible by, and use them to run the same exercise as before for an
// unknown number of phrases. Use the "Widget" constructor to configure the available numbers and
// phrases. Then call a function in widget to fill in the answers array the same as before for every
// number from 1 until a given parameter length.
// E.G. normal Fizzbuzz would have the phrases array {"Fizz", "Buzz"} and numbers array of {3,5}


// overall code goes below
int length = 80; // this could be any number
int[] numbers = new int[]{3,5,7,9}; // this could be any length of positive interger numbers
String[] phrases = new String[]{"Fizz", "Buzz", "Mozz", "Wazz"}; // this could have any number of phrases
String[] answers = new String[length];

widget Fizz = new widget(3, "Fizz");
widget Buzz = new widget(5, "Buzz");
Widget Mozz = new Widget(7, "Mozz");
Widget Wazz = new Widget(9, "Wazz");

for (int i=1; i<= lenth; i++)(
if (Fizz.idDivisible(i))(
holder += Buzz.getResponse();
	answers(i) = --;


//code for your object goes below
