// WildStang Fall Software Week 2 Assignment 1

// As always, edit this file while in your branch of this folder (repository)

///////////////////////////////////////
// Activity 1 - assign the variable "answer" to the factorial of the input variable "input"

int input = 8; // this could be any whole positive interger number
int answer;
//your code goes below






///////////////////////////////////////
// Activity 2 - assign the variable "answer" to the modulus of the input variable "total" and input variable "divisor"
// Do NOT use the modulus function (%)

int total = 36; // this could be any whole positive interger number
int divisor = 13; // this could be any whole positive interger number
int answer;
// your code goes below






///////////////////////////////////////
// Activity 3 - assign the variable "answer" to the "nth" term of the fibonacci sequence, where "nth" is an input variable
// the fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc - starts at 1, then always the sum of the two previous values
// so if the input "nth" is 3, the answer is 2. If "nth" is 4, the answer is 3. If "nth" is 5, the answer is 5. If "nth" is 6, answer is 8 etc.

int nth = 21; // this could be any whole positive interger number
int answer;
// your code goes below






///////////////////////////////////////
// Activity 4 - Fizzbuzz. Use System.out.println() to print what the answer is for every value from 1 until length
// Every time a number is divisible by 3, the String should be "fizz." If it is divisible by 5, it should be "buzz."
// If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it is "fizzbuzz." Otherwise, the String should be the number.

int length = 50; // this could be any whole positive interger number
// your code goes below
