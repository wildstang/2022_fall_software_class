//WildStang Fall Software Week 6 Assignment 1

//As always, edit this file while in your branch of this folder (repository)

///////////////////////////////////////
//Take the subsystem you coded for last week, and add in a couple of methods and autonomous steps to enable it to be used in autonomous. 
//You should add some methods to the subsystem so that an autonomous step can control the subsystem.

//Steps to add
//Deploy intake (and run intake wheels)
//retract intake (and turn off intake wheels)
//turn on/off feed (should take a boolean argument - true for on, false for off)
//set shooter speed (with a double argument for the power)
//turn shooter on/off
