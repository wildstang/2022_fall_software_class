//For a given array "array" of input length "length," put the values of "array" into the array "answer" sorted from least to greatest
//This should work for any value of "length", and for any random values of "array" - aka don't hard code what is the example
//As an example, if length = 4, array is "4,2,8,6", then the answer should be "2,4,6,8"

int length = 8;//This could be any whole positive interger number
int[] array = []{7,6,12,8,0,94,6,2};//these could be any whole positive interger numbers
int[] array = [length];
//your code goes below
