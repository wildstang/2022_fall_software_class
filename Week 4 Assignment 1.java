// Create your own autonomous program using the following steps

intakeOnStep();
shootStep(3,3); // distance is the distance it will score from
stopShootingStep(1,7);
driveStep(9,1); // distance that the robot drives in a straight line
turnStep(45); // the number of degrees the robot turns
delayStep(); // does nothing for some seconds

// Your robot is starting at (0,0), and can hold a maximum of two cargo. There are cargo
// at (1,7), (3,3), (7,6), and (9,1). There is a goal at (10,10) to score the cargo in. We want
